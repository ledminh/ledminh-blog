    "Starting my career rather late, in my 30s, I believe hardworking and persistence will eventually pay off.",
    "In my past life, I was a doctor in Vietnam, radiologist, to be specific. But then I quit and moved to the U.S to build my career again from the ground up. This time, it is in Computer Science. I graduated from San Jose State University with the bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Fall 2020.",
    "I have been fascinated by computer since I was a kid. The beauty of its precision amazed me. When learning computer science in SJSU, I appreciated it even more. I tried to learn as much as I can about anything related to computer science. I find the beauty in any subject at school, whether it is C++, Java, Linux, Python, Data Structure, Assembly, MySQL or even Verilog as well as computer architecture.", 
    "I learned Javascript, CSS, HTML and some front-end frameworks like React, D3 at home and felt in love with them. I even learned some back-end techs like Node, mongoDB and, guess what, I felt in love with them too. I have already had some experience in using MySQL when doing maintenance for an online forum of more than 8,500 members about medicine back in Vietnam. At SJSU, I had a chance to actually learn about it, academically.", 
    "I do not have much working experience, but I am eager to learn what I have not known yet. I am opened to all entry level positions in Computer Science.", 
    "To compensate for my lack of working experience, I built this website from scratch using React. If you look at the project section, you will see a blog integrated into it that is also built from scratch using React. I hope these will be considered as a proof that I can build a somewhat complex system on React (and on programming in general).",
    "When I am not busy with school, you can see me coding, learning how to code, and writing. Scientific writing is also my hobby. I have a wordpress blog on science in Vietnamese. My near future plan would be to code it in React entirely."
